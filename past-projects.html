                Claim Amount Detection</h3>
            <p>DSpearheaded the development of an automated allowed amount detection system for Cigna Healthcare over 9 months. This project involved utilising spaCy library for NLP, along with HuggingFace transformer (Roberta-Base) to extract key information from contractual texts, building robust Gitlab CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment, developing Python scripts for data processing, and creating a Flask-based REST API for seamless integration with existing systems. Also used some Machine Learning models for text classification (e.g. Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Clustering, etc.)</p>

            <h3>Graceful Labeling</h3>
            <p>This was a term project at IITG.
                Graceful labelling is one of the most interesting problems of the Graph Theory in the field of Mathematics. During this project, I studied different techniques for graceful labelling of some classes of graphs. I also found a technique for graceful labelling for a particular class of trees.</p>
