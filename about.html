        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am a Data Engineer (Data and Analytics) at Virtusa, where I work with Cigna Healthcare to deliver AI and cloud solutions that meet their business needs and goals. I have successfully implemented multiple projects using machine learning, CI/CD, and AWS technologies, enhancing the performance, efficiency, and scalability of the client's systems and applications. Additionally I am also exploring the field of Generative AI by means of various trainings and hackathons at Virtusa.</p>

        <p> I hold a postgraduate degree in Mathematics and Computing from the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, where I received the Reliance Foundation Scholarship in AI and CS for my academic excellence and research potential. I also have certifications in AI chatbot development, web development, and Code Jam from Coursera and Google. I am passionate about learning new skills and exploring new domains in AI and cloud computing, and I aspire to become a leader and innovator in this field.</p>
