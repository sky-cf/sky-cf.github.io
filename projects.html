            <h3>Claim Intake and Review Automation</h3>
            <p>Currently serving as a Data Engineer with <a href="https://www.virtusa.com/">Virtusa</a> for <a href="https://www.cigna.com/">Cigna Healthcare</a>, a prominent healthcare organisation, where I've spent around 2 years. My role focuses on developing and implementing automated solutions for claim intake and review. Leveraging AWS services (e.g., Lambda, Glue, S3, SQS, RDS), Python scripting, Terraform for infrastructure as code, Jenkins for CI/CD, PostgreSQL for database querying, I contribute to streamlined data workflows and enhanced operational efficiency.</p>

            <h3>
                Claim Amount Detection</h3>
            <p>DSpearheaded the development of an automated allowed amount detection system for Cigna Healthcare over 9 months. This project involved utilising spaCy library for NLP, along with HuggingFace transformer (Roberta-Base) to extract key information from contractual texts, building robust Gitlab CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment, developing Python scripts for data processing, and creating a Flask-based REST API for seamless integration with existing systems. Also used some Machine Learning models for text classification (e.g. Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Clustering, etc.)</p>

            <h3>Graceful Labeling</h3>
            <p>This was a term project at IITG.
                Graceful labelling is one of the most interesting problems of the Graph Theory in the field of Mathematics. During this project, I studied different techniques for graceful labelling of some classes of graphs. I also found a technique for graceful labelling for a particular class of trees.</p>
